-- Auto-emitted by stellar-diver: a relational abstraction of the contract,
-- one `Step → Prop` per entrypoint, in the style of SorobanAmm.lean.
--
-- RECONSTRUCTED from the bytecode, in terms of call arguments, storage slots
-- (real DataKey names) and token ledgers:
--   * effects, in program order, as a chain of states s1, s2, …: SEP-41
--     transfers (`xfer`: ledger, from, to, amount) and storage writes, each
--     under the (non-panic) branch condition it runs in;
--   * every read sees the state at its program point (a balance read after a
--     transfer reads the post-transfer ledger; a slot read after a write
--     reads the write — e.g. a token's self-transfer nets to zero);
--   * guards: require_auth, every panic condition and `Err` return, as the
--     condition to pass.
-- Values are rebuilt through i128 helper routines (__muloti4 / __divti3), out-
-- pointer returns and by-reference closure captures on the wasm shadow stack.
--
-- Storage keys: `.var` (unit variant), `.entry` / `.tup` (variants with one /
-- several fields), `.fld k f` (field f of the #[contracttype] struct stored at
-- k, nested structs field by field) and `.has k` (k's presence: set → 1,
-- remove → 0). Struct arguments' fields are args named `config.limit`.
--
-- STILL `opaque`: values from loops (e.g. an integer sqrt), tuple and whole-
-- struct returns, enum values carried as data, and whatever the
-- reconstruction could not resolve (a branch condition so becomes an opaque
-- `Step → Bool`, never `False`).
-- ASSUMES token ledgers are keyed by the storage slot holding the token
-- address (`"TokenA"`, `"Offer.buy_token"`), i.e. distinct slots hold
-- distinct tokens; an absent key reads as 0 (`get(k).unwrap_or(0)`); the
-- host's address order (`obj_cmp`) is the order on `Addr`; loops terminate.
-- Reads/writes inside one helper call are ordered at the call's position.
